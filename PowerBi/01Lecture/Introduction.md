## Key Components of Power BI

Power BI consists of several tools and services:

### 1. Power BI Desktop

A Windows application used to build reports. This is where most data modeling and visual creation happens.

### 2. Power BI Service (Cloud)

An online platform used to publish, share, and collaborate on reports and dashboards.

### 3. Power BI Mobile

Mobile applications for viewing dashboards and reports on phones and tablets.

### 4. Power BI Gateway

Connects on-premises data sources with Power BI Service.

### 5. Power BI Report Builder

Used for creating paginated (print-friendly) reports.

### 6. Power BI Embedded

For developers to embed reports into custom applications.

## How Power BI Works (Workflow)

Power BI follows a simple data workflow:

1. **Get Data**: Connect to sources such as Excel, SQL, CSV, APIs, etc.
2. **Transform Data**: Clean, shape, and model data using Power Query.
3. **Visualize Data**: Create charts, graphs, maps, KPIs, and dashboards.
4. **Publish & Share**: Upload reports to Power BI Service.
5. **Refresh Data**: Schedule automatic data refresh from connected sources.

## Power BI Building Blocks

Power BI consists of 5 core building blocks:

### 1. Datasets

A collection of data imported or connected to Power BI.

### 2. Reports

Multiple pages of visuals based on a dataset.

### 3. Dashboards

A single-page snapshot containing visuals pinned from reports.

### 4. Tiles

Individual visual elements on a dashboard.

### 5. Visualizations

Charts, graphs, maps, tables, etc.
