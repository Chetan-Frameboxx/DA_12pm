# Lecture 1: Introduction to Statistics & Data Types

---

## Theory

### 1. What is Statistics?

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with:

* Collecting data
* Organizing data
* Analyzing data
* Interpreting data
* Presenting data for decision-making

In simple terms, statistics helps convert **raw data into meaningful information**.

---

### 2. Role of Statistics in Data Analysis

Statistics plays a critical role in every stage of data analysis:

* **Data Collection**: Deciding sample size and data sources
* **Data Cleaning**: Identifying missing values and outliers
* **Data Exploration**: Understanding patterns, trends, and distributions
* **Decision Making**: Supporting business, scientific, and policy decisions
* **Prediction & Forecasting**: Using past data to estimate future outcomes

Real-world applications:

* Business: Sales forecasting, customer behavior analysis
* Healthcare: Disease trends, clinical trials
* Government: Census, economic indicators
* Technology: A/B testing, recommendation systems

### 3. Population vs Sample

#### Population

* The **entire group** of individuals or items under study
* Example: All customers of an e-commerce platform

#### Sample

* A **subset** of the population
* Used when population study is costly or impractical
* Example: 1,000 selected customers from the platform

| Basis    | Population | Sample      |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Size     | Large      | Smaller     |
| Cost     | High       | Low         |
| Accuracy | Exact      | Approximate |

### 4. Types of Statistics

#### 4.1 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe data.

Includes:

* Mean, Median, Mode
* Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
* Tables, charts, and graphs

Example:

* Average marks of a class
* Monthly sales summary

#### 4.2 Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics draw conclusions about a population using sample data.

Includes:

* Hypothesis testing
* Confidence intervals
* Regression analysis

Example:

* Predicting election results from survey data
* Estimating average income from sample surveys

### 5. Types of Data

#### 5.1 Qualitative vs Quantitative Data

**Qualitative (Categorical) Data**

* Describes qualities or categories
* Non-numerical
* Example: Gender, Color, Department

**Quantitative (Numerical) Data**

* Represents numbers and quantities
* Can be measured or counted
* Example: Age, Salary, Marks

---

#### 5.2 Discrete vs Continuous Data

**Discrete Data**

* Countable values
* Usually whole numbers
* Example: Number of students, Number of orders

**Continuous Data**

* Measurable values
* Can take decimal values
* Example: Height, Weight, Temperature

---

### 6. Levels of Measurement

#### 6.1 Nominal Scale

* Categories with no specific order
* Only classification is possible

Examples:

* Blood group (A, B, AB, O)
* Country names

---

#### 6.2 Ordinal Scale

* Categories with a meaningful order
* Difference between values is not measurable

Examples:

* Education level (School, College, Postgraduate)
* Customer satisfaction (Low, Medium, High)

---

#### 6.3 Interval Scale

* Ordered data with equal intervals
* No true zero

Examples:

* Temperature in Celsius
* Calendar years

---

#### 6.4 Ratio Scale

* Ordered data with equal intervals
* Has a true zero

Examples:

* Height, Weight
* Income, Sales amount

---

## Practical Examples (Full Scenarios)

### Example 1: Student Dataset

| Student Name | Gender | Age | Marks | Height (cm) |
| ------------ | ------ | --- | ----- | ----------- |
| A            | Male   | 20  | 85    | 170         |
| B            | Female | 21  | 78    | 165         |

* Gender → Qualitative, Nominal
* Age → Quantitative, Discrete, Ratio
* Marks → Quantitative, Discrete, Ratio
* Height → Quantitative, Continuous, Ratio

---

### Example 2: E-commerce Dataset

| Order ID | Product Category | Rating | Order Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 101      | Electronics      | 5      | 25000       |
| 102      | Clothing         | 3      | 1500        |

* Product Category → Qualitative, Nominal
* Rating → Qualitative, Ordinal
* Order Value → Quantitative, Continuous, Ratio

## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Identify Population and Sample

A company has 50,000 employees. A survey is conducted on 2,000 employees.

* Identify the population
* Identify the sample

---

### Task 2: Identify Type of Statistics

Classify the following as Descriptive or Inferential:

* Average monthly sales report
* Predicting next year’s revenue

---

### Task 3: Data Type Classification

Identify data type and measurement scale:

1. Mobile number
2. Customer feedback (Poor, Good, Excellent)
3. Daily temperature in Celsius
4. Number of products sold

---

### Task 4: Real-World Mapping

Choose any real-world dataset (school, hospital, business) and list:

* 3 qualitative variables
* 3 quantitative variables

---

### Task 5: Think & Answer

Why is understanding data types important before applying statistical methods?

---

## Learning Outcomes (Revisited)

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

* Explain what statistics is and why it is important
* Differentiate between population and sample
* Distinguish descriptive and inferential statistics
* Correctly identify data types and measurement scales
