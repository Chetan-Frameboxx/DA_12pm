# Lecture 2: Measures of Central Tendency

---

## Theory

### 1. What are Measures of Central Tendency?

Measures of central tendency are statistical values that describe the **center or typical value** of a dataset.

They help answer the question:

> *“What is the average or most representative value of the data?”*

The three main measures are:

* Mean
* Median
* Mode

---

### 2. Mean (Arithmetic Average)

#### Definition

The **mean** is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values.

#### Formula

Mean = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations)

#### Key Characteristics

* Uses **all data values**
* Sensitive to **extreme values (outliers)**
* Most commonly used average

#### Example

Dataset: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
Mean = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50) / 5 = 30

---

### 3. Median

#### Definition

The **median** is the middle value when data is arranged in **ascending or descending order**.

#### Steps to Calculate

* Sort the data
* If count is odd → middle value
* If count is even → average of two middle values

#### Key Characteristics

* Not affected by extreme values
* Best for **skewed data**

#### Example

Dataset: 5, 10, 15, 20, 100
Median = 15

---

### 4. Mode

#### Definition

The **mode** is the value that occurs **most frequently** in a dataset.

#### Key Characteristics

* Can have **one mode, multiple modes, or no mode**
* Useful for **categorical data**

#### Example

Dataset: 2, 4, 4, 6, 8
Mode = 4

### 5. Comparison: Mean vs Median vs Mode

| Feature                     | Mean | Median | Mode      |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ------ | --------- |
| Uses all values             | Yes  | No     | No        |
| Affected by outliers        | Yes  | No     | No        |
| Suitable for skewed data    | No   | Yes    | Sometimes |
| Works with categorical data | No   | No     | Yes       |

---

### 6. Effect of Outliers

An **outlier** is an extreme value that differs significantly from other observations.

#### Example

Dataset A: 20, 25, 30, 35, 40
Mean = 30, Median = 30

Dataset B: 20, 25, 30, 35, 200
Mean = 62, Median = 30

Observation:

* Mean changes drastically
* Median remains stable

---

### 7. Business Interpretation of Averages

#### Mean in Business

* Average revenue
* Average salary
* Average sales per day

Risk: Can be misleading if data has outliers

#### Median in Business

* Median income
* Median house price

Benefit: Represents typical customer or employee

#### Mode in Business

* Most sold product
* Most common customer category

## Practical Examples (Full Scenarios)

### Example 1: Employee Salary Data

Salaries (in ₹): 25,000, 28,000, 30,000, 32,000, 1,00,000

* Mean = High (affected by CEO salary)
* Median = 30,000 (represents typical employee)
* Mode = None

Correct Measure: **Median**

---

### Example 2: Product Sales Quantity

Units Sold: 5, 10, 10, 10, 20, 25

* Mean = 13.3
* Median = 10
* Mode = 10

Correct Measure: **Mode** (most demanded quantity)

---

## Practice Tasks

### Task 1: Calculation

Find Mean, Median, and Mode:

* 12, 15, 18, 20, 25

---

### Task 2: Outlier Impact

Calculate mean and median:

* 30, 32, 35, 38, 200

Which value is affected more and why?

---

### Task 3: Business Decision

Choose the correct measure:

1. Average house price
2. Most popular shoe size
3. Average marks of a class

---

### Task 4: Conceptual Question

Why is mean not always the best measure of central tendency?

---

### Task 5: Real-World Dataset

Collect data for 10 students’ marks and:

* Calculate mean, median, and mode
* Interpret which measure best represents performance

---

## Learning Outcomes (Revisited)

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

* Calculate mean, median, and mode
* Understand the effect of outliers
* Interpret averages in business scenarios
* Choose the correct measure of central tendency based on data type
